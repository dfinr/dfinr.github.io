I'm a coffee geek, expert sailor, and not a great guitar player. I'm also the Technical Editor and Developer Advocate at [vultr.com](https://www.vultr.com). If you'd like to participate in [Vultr's Trusted Author Program](https://www.vultr.com/docs/trusted-author-program) or have a question about Vultr's infrastructure, [contact me](mailto:dfinster@vultr.com) or look me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dfinr).

I'm looking for new and exciting technology. Tell me about exciting things you are doing with CI/CD, immutable infrastructure, containerization, machine learning, cloud infrastructure, and especially anything I don't know about yet.
