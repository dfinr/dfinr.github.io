# Shower Mat Pedalboard

I needed a small pedalboard for the spare bedroom, and the pre-built ones are too big and expensive for what I do. I don't play on stage, and when I drag my equipment to a friend's house, it needs to be as portable as possible.  

It's a happy coincidence that a cheap "Bamboo Bath and Shower Mat" is a guitar pedalboard in disguise. Most are natural wood color, but I found this one painted black.

You'll probably find this one if you search for "[Bamboo Bath and Shower Mat(19.7 x 13 inches), Non-Slip](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffcm&q=Bamboo+Bath+and+Shower+Mat(19.7+x+13+inches)%2C+Non-Slip&ia=web)". Use that as inspiration, you might want the next size larger. I deliberately chose a small one. This project took eight feet of 3M Dual Lock to secure everything, which is excellent stuff, and you'll need a pry bar to get the pedals back off, but also $2 per foot. If I did this again, I might go with a cheaper velcro. In the end, I saved a few bucks, and the result is better suited to my style than anything I could find pre-built.

The total cost was $38 and an hour of my time for planning and assembly.
