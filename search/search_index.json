It's a happy coincidence that a cheap \"Bamboo Bath and Shower Mat\" is a guitar pedalboard in disguise. Most are natural wood color, but I found this one painted black.

This project took eight feet of 3M Dual Lock to secure everything, which is excellent stuff, and you'll need a pry bar to get the pedals back off, but also $2 per foot.
